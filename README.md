# The Best AI Engineering Learning Resources (Curated List)

AI engineering is THE ULTIMATE SKILL in the age of AI - because as AI engineers we deploy models in the real world. AI - no matter how powerful - would be useless without AI engineers!

The goal of this resource guide is to help you deepen your understanding of AI engineering, prompting, and related fields. I have curated these resources from various GitHub repositories, Reddit, X, and other online sources.
